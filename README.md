## Education

## Areas of Interest

## Professional Experience
### Undergraduate Researcher @ MIT HAUS (_June 2023 - Present_)
- Designed, assembled, and successfully implemented a CO₂ pressurization system to create foaming pellets at a new scale for additive manufacturing. Paper coming soon.
- Demonstrated viability of increasing layer height on pile footing prints as a means of reducing print time while maintaining satisfactory performance. [Publication](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-77697-7_16)
- Reduced the mass of a **HUD compliant** roof design by 30% by using **SolidWorks FEA** to validate new geometries.
- Assisted fellow undergraduate researchers in BAAM use and validated new print surfaces.
- Compiled relevant **ASTM** and **ISO** standards for preliminary characterization of our BAAM 3D printer.

**CO2 Dilution System:** Polymer pellets absorb carbon dioxide while safely residing in a hydraulic accumulator surrounded by a ballistic blanket. Revised designs will swap the hydraulic accumulator for a reusable and lighter solution. Experimentation with polymers other than PET and the use of additives may also produce foam with a higher expansion ratio.

![Demonstration of floor scale]({{ "/assets/scale-example-floor.png" | relative_url }})
**Scale of our Research:** The size of the floor, footings, and concrete bags provides a sense of the scale MIT HAUS regularly operates at. This image was taken during a loading test.

![MIT HAUS Curved]({{ "/assets/mit-haus-curved.png" | relative_url }})
**Pushing Boundaries:** Use of curvature, trusses, and hierarchy allows us to leverage additive manufacturing to create robust yet lightweight structures. Simple FEA cases are verified by testing on small FDM models in light of the modeling challenges posed by the anisotropic nature of additively manufactured parts.

### Engineering Intern @ Radia, Inc. (_June 2024 - August 2024_)
- Sized composite panels according to durability and deflection requirements while minimizing weight by creating a **MATLAB** model relating mass and deflection. Analyzed potential failure modes for composite panels reinforced by hat-stiffeners using hand calcs and relevant NACA literature.
- Proposed a new fairing design and substantiated it with drag impact calculations and analysis on manufacturability. Conducted a trade study to determine ideal panel dimensions subject to transportation, weight, and assembly considerations. Advocated for these and other key design decisions during weekly meetings with other stakeholders.
- Made a **CATIA** model using **3DXPERIENCE** for my team’s structural concept while allowing for interaction with adjacent aircraft systems.

## Projects
### Home-Built Jet Engine
- Developed a ceramic matrix composite that could be manufactured at home and withstand 2000 °C. Molded the composite around 3D printed PLA forms for easy reproducibility and consistency between mating surfaces upon assembly.
- **Milled** different fuel injectors to allow for tuning between runs. Calculated areas for each stage of air addition and fuel injection to reduce exhaust temperatures and extend turbine lifespan.
- Welded a test rig to hold the jet engine, a protective piece of acrylic and pressure and temperature gauges.

![Clean Jet Engine]({{ "/assets/clean-jet-engine.jpg" | relative_url }})
**All systems go?** The engine is almost ready to fire up, except for a missing battery to drive the ignition system.

![Fire Exhaust Jet Engine]({{ "/assets/jet-fire-exhaust.JPEG" | relative_url }})
**Running Hot:** Excessive liquid propane and help from a leaf blower push the jet engine beyond its optimal operating range after a successful test earlier in the day.

![Fuel Injectors]({{ "/assets/fuel-injector.jpg" | relative_url }})
**Injector Selection:** Four fuel injectors machined on a Bridgeport mill boast holes as small as 1/64". 

### Deep Sea Soil Sampler
- Designed and constructed a mechanically activated and actuated sediment collector used at a depth of 11 km following the Five Deeps Expedition. Used aluminum linkages and pulleys to efficiently transfer spring energy to a sample collector where electronics and hydraulics would fail under the pressure.
- Calculated pressure plate area and geometry to avoid premature triggering from shocks and descent in the water column. Tested different scoop designs and end-caps to maximize the sample volume captured and retained.

![Original Prototype Sampler]({{ "/assets/original-sampler.jpg" | relative_url }})
**Surefire Design:** Operating with a simple trigger and a cam, the first prototype was prone to misfiring upon dropping into the ocean but was otherwise reliable. This performance was satisfactory given that the consistency of the landing site was completely unknown at the time.

![Challenger Deep Sample]({{ "/assets/challenger-deep-sample.jpg" | relative_url }})
**Fast Turnaround:** This sample was in Texas within a month of us shipping out the first prototype, and taught us that the floor in the Mariana Trench was soft, informing the design for the next set of samplers.

![Soil Sampler Early]({{ "/assets/soil-sampler-early.jpg" | relative_url }})
**Informed Design:** Better understanding the challenge of dropping into the ocean and descent, these samplers were calibrated in a pool to avoid misfires. The amount of material captured was also improved by the addition of relief vents in the back to allow water to flow through the snapping sampler claw.

![Soil Sampler Late]({{ "/assets/soil-sampler-late.jpg" | relative_url }})
**Raising the bar:** The demand for stratified soil samples forced an abandonment of the claw mechanism and motivated a design that would push the sample collector perpendicular to the silt upon which it rested.

### Dual Fluid Impeller System
- Designed a fluid impeller and casing for metal and polymer SLS manufacturing, navigating the challenge of uncertain achievable tolerances. Created **engineering drawings** for the impeller and casings. Achieved the lowest leakage of all six teams in the class and avoided near-critical operation. Used **CFD** to create an estimate of pressures and velocities for each impeller. Used a **data acquisition system** to characterize the pump and measure displacement near the critical speed of a rotor system.

### Satellite Design and Analysis
- Designed a fictional probe mission to Europa. Ensured the satellite packaging could fit within a Falcon Heavy fairing and survive the vibrational environment of takeoff. Reduced cantilevers and selected composites where appropriate to eliminate dangerous vibrational modes using **SolidWorks FEA** tools.

- Also created a probe to measure the salinity of a pool into which the satellite deploys, simulating a mock Europa mission. Designed a voltage divider and **Arduino** code to calculate the salinity of the water into which the probe is dropped by using spaced electrodes.

### Canonical Heat Addition Case
- Produced a report discussing the canonical case of heat addition and removal from a stovepipe ramjet as presented in Oswatitsch's _Gas Dynamics._ Created an analytical model for thrust generation in the supersonic regime and validated it against Ansys. [Download the paper]({{ "/16_120_Final_Project.pdf" | relative_url }})

![Shock Measurement Angles]({{ "/assets/ansys-validation.png" | relative_url }})
**Geometric Agreement:** CFD models show very close alignment to analytical models that solve for shock angles by pressure equilibrium. Overall, analytical and CFD models show the same trends, except for the supersonic choking case, where analytical models fall short.
